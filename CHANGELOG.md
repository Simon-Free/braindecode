## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- amplitude gradients are correctly computed for layers with multiple filters
  (before, they were accidentally summed over all previous filters in the layer) [@robintibor](https://github.com/robintibor)
- get_output_shape and compute_amplitude_gradients assume 3d, not 4d inputs [@robintibor](https://github.com/robintibor)
